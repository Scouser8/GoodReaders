<h1>Upload Image</h1>
 
<form action="/upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="file" accept="image/*" name="photo" >
        <input type="submit" value="upload">
</form>
       

/*
 **action="/upload" ==> define the route 
 **enctype="multipart/form-data" ==> this attribute is important because the default value of enctype is
  application/x-www-form-urlencoded which does not support image upload
 **(type = file )==>  file chooser and also allows us to define what type of file to accept
 **value as “image/*” =>> to accept all types of image if i want to accept a specific extension 
 such as jpeg set value as "image/jpeg"
 

  backend code :
  first install multer 
  /* to upload images */
  const multer = require('multer');
  const upload = multer({dest: __dirname + '/public/uploads/images'});
  
  // handle the path 

app.post('/upload', upload.single('photo'), (req, res) => {
    if(req.file) {
        res.json(req.file);
    }
    else throw 'error';
  });
